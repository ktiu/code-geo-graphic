# CODE/GEO/GRAPHIC

## Call for contributions

In this workshop we consider computer code for for geographic or cartographic projects. Participants discuss their code, others’ code, and code within geo/cartographic contexts in general. Exchange and identification of research issues will be the focus. 

Contributions should be prepared in advance for lightning talks (maximum 5 minutes and 5 slides). They can include:

* An interesting piece of code that facilitated a (past or ongoing) project. This is (probably) not a stand-alone program and should be limited to 20 lines or so.

* A brief essay-style presentation reflecting on code and its role in a project, asking questions about it, and/or investigating its affordances and implications. Visuals are optional, even if the code helped produce a map.

We welcome contributions from scholars at all stages of their career and at all levels of coding proficiency. This is a low-threshold event to talk about code.

Please send a short outline of your idea (with or without actual code) to <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a> until December 31, 2017.

## About the workshop

The workshop will be held in Berlin on April 20, 2018. It is organized by Francis Harvey, Florian Ledermann, Sebastian Meier and Till Straube, who have met through the [Digitale Geographien network](http://digitale-geographien.de)

On the day of the meet-up, participants present their contributions in a series of lightening talks. After lunch, using an unconference format break-out group discussions about sharing code, making code and thinking about future mapmaking coding projects. A workshop board collects results of these discussions. A moderated discussion of the topics concludes the workshop. 

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.
