# CODE/GEO/GRAPHIC

<p><center> <i>Workshop in Berlin on April 19, 2018<br />
(immediately preceeding the <a href="http://digitale-geographien.de/">Digitale Geographien meeting</a>)</i> </center></p>

## Call for contributions

In this workshop we take closer looks at pieces of code used for geographic or cartographic projects. Participants are invited to discuss their code, others’ code, and code within geo/cartographic contexts in general. The focus of the workshop will be an exchange of ideas and identification of research issues.

Contributions should be prepared in advance for lightning talks (maximum 5 minutes and 5 slides). They can include:

* An interesting piece of code that facilitated a (past or ongoing) project. This is (probably) not a stand-alone program and should be limited to 20 lines or so.

* A brief essay-style presentation reflecting on code and its role in a project, asking questions about it, and/or investigating its affordances and implications. Visuals and demonstrations are optional even if the code helped produce a map.

We welcome contributions from scholars at all stages of their career and at all levels of coding proficiency. This is a low-threshold event to talk openly about code.

Please register until January 31, 2018.

## About the workshop

The workshop will be held at the [Technologiestiftung Berlin](https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/en/foundation/directions-contact/) on April 19, 2018.

It is organized by Francis Harvey, Florian Ledermann, Sebastian Meier and Till Straube, who met through the [Digitale Geographien network](http://digitale-geographien.de).

On the day of the meet-up, participants present their contributions in a series of lightning talks. After lunch, using an unconference format break-out group discussions about sharing code, making code and thinking about future mapmaking coding projects. A workshop board collects results of these discussions. A moderated discussion of the topics concludes the workshop.

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments at <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>.
