# CODE/GEO/GRAPHIC

<p><center> <i>Workshop in Berlin on April 19, 2018<br />
(immediately preceeding the <a href="http://digitale-geographien.de/">Digitale Geographien meeting</a>)</i> </center></p>

## Call for contributions

In this workshop we take closer looks at pieces of code used for geographic or cartographic projects. Participants are invited to discuss their code, othersâ€™ code, and code within geo/cartographic contexts in general. The focus of the workshop will be an exchange of ideas and identification of research issues.

Contributions should be prepared in advance for lightning talks (maximum 5 minutes and 5 slides). They can include:

* An interesting piece of code that facilitated a (past or ongoing) project. This is (probably) not a stand-alone program and should be limited to 20 lines or so.

* A brief essay-style presentation reflecting on code and its role in a project, asking questions about it, and/or investigating its affordances and implications. Visuals and demonstrations are optional even if the code helped produce a map.

We welcome contributions from scholars at all stages of their career and at all levels of coding proficiency. This is a low-threshold event to talk openly about code.

## About the workshop

The workshop will be held at the [Technologiestiftung Berlin](https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/en/foundation/directions-contact/) on April 19, 2018.

It is organized by Francis Harvey, Florian Ledermann, Sebastian Meier and Till Straube, who met through the [Digitale Geographien network](http://digitale-geographien.de).

On the day of the meet-up, participants present their contributions in a series of lightning talks. After lunch, using an unconference format break-out group discussions about sharing code, making code and thinking about future mapmaking coding projects. A workshop board collects results of these discussions. A moderated discussion of the topics concludes the workshop.
